# Conductor.jl

**Conductor.jl is a WIP. If the idea of a Julia-based neuronal network simulator engine sounds exciting to you, please feel free to reach out**

Conductor.jl aims to be a platform for quickly and flexibly building high-performance,
multi-scale neuronal network models in Julia. Under the hood it's being built on top of
ModelingToolkit.jl--so all the tools available in the SciML and DiffEq ecosystem are (or
soon will be) useable and composable with the neuronal models built here.

To install, tagged releases are available through the public registry:

```julia
# From Julia REPL
]add Conductor
```

While Conductor.jl is still in early development, you can get a feel for what's going on by looking in
the `demo` directory of this repository. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/wsphillips/Conductor.jl
```
Then from a Julia REPL:
```julia
cd("/path/to/Conductor.jl/demo")
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()
```

You should then be able to open and step through the various demo script examples.

## Acknowledgements

Conductor.jl is based on the acausal component modeling paradigm in
[ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl). The initial draft of
Conductor.jl was derived from an implementation of a stomatogastric ganglion (STG) model,
which was written in Julia by [Dhruva Raman](http://www-control.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/DhruvaRaman), and based on published works by [Astrid Prinz](http://www.biology.emory.edu/research/Prinz/) et
al.

The original Julia/ModelingToolkit STG model template: [NeuronBuilder.jl](https://github.com/Dhruva2/NeuronBuilder)
